**Networking Foundations v1.0**

This workshop is intended to give you a strong foundation on Networking basics that are highly used in the world of microservices and Kubernetes Networking.

Module 1 - A quick intro to Networking Basics!
In this module, we'll review Networking and the OSI model, along with what makes packets move around the network. 
We'll also explore the current node networking configuration.

Module 2 - Let's Connect!
We dive into connectivity between multiple nodes and how this is facilitated. We'll also explore MAC and IP addresses, and how these are calculated.

Module 3 - Get to the Gateway!
Not all networks are the same shape or size! We need ways to get to other networks and we use Routers to do this. In this module we'll explore Layer 3 connectivity and typical protocols used.

Module 4 - It's not DNS, it can't be DNS, it was DNS.
DNS is critical to all applications! This is how we resolve IP addresses to human-readable names. IP's change, names don't!

Module 5 - I'm a teapot - Undertanding HTTP codes and Layer 7
As we climb up the OSI stack, we can use Layer 7 to gain insights, and manipulate how our applications communicate. But first, we need to understand what goes on here and dig into HTTP status codes, the API, and other elements.

Module 6 - Containers, Kubernetes, and Networking
Let's review containers, Kubernetes, and how we provide Networking.
