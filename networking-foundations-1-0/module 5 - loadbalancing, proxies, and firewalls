With the foundations of networking in place, there are tools and technologies that create higher levels of availability and resiliency.
A lot of this is derived from the information that's shared with us at Layer 7 or the HTTP layer.

We are going to walk through how to provide load-balancing for a few basic HTTP services deployed into a small container environment. 
We will also working through setting up firewall policies that filter traffic at Layers 3 and 4, and cover how WAFs provided upper layer security
Finally we'll see how Proxies and technologies like Envoy play a huge role in service request routing and security.
