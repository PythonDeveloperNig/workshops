Get to the Gateway! 
Not all networks are the same shape or size! 
We need ways to get to other networks and we use Routers to do this. 
In this module we'll explore Layer 2/3 connectivity and typical protocols used.

Virtual Networks, VLANs
Understanding VXLANs and Logical Networks
Understanding Leaf-Spine architectures eVPN and BGP,
Why Layer 3 addressing and subnet masks are important
How we learn about other networks and the need for routing (Dynamic vs Static routing)
Constructing a static route (default, specific prefix)
Dynamic routing with BGP
