In this lab, you will deploy the sample application to your Kubernetes cluster, and expose the web-api service to the Istio ingress gateway and configure secure access to it.

## Deploy the sample application


## Configure the inbound traffic


## Secure the inbound traffic

Congratulations, you have exposed the web-api service to Istio ingress gateway securely. We'll explore adding services to the mesh in the [next lab](./03-add-services-to-mesh.md).
