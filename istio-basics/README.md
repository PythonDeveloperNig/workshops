# Get Started With Istio Service Mesh

Microservices can be complicated and difficult to manage. These complexities have given rise to a new solution called service mesh. Istio is the most dominant service mesh in production today per a CNCF survey in late 2020. This workshop explains how to get started with Istio by incrementally adopting Istio and observing the benefits that Istio service mesh brings to you. We will explore various functions and benefits that Istio provides to your organization. We cover the following topics in this workshop:

* Install Istio
* Secure services with Istio Ingress Gateway
* Add Services to the Mesh
* Secure interservices communication with Istio
* Control Traffic

This workshop is intended for developers and operators. Anyone responsible for the delivery of microservices will find the workshop valuable. We assume you are just learning about Istio and service mesh.

This workshop also includes a certification option. This credential, offered by Solo.io with Credly, certifies that you possess the introductory skills, to install, secure services, add services to the Mesh, secure interservices communication, and control traffic. At the completion of the workshop, you will be able to take an assessment and a score 80% or higher earns the certification.
